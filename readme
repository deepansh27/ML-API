Procedure:

- Start a virtual environment and install requirements
- Build sentiment classifier
- Write app.py which is the API application that will be deployed
- Update requirements.txt as you write the code
- Test the API



Ways to use the api:

- Using Jupiter:

    Code:
    install requests
    url = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/'
    params ={'query': 'that movie was boring'}
    response = requests.get(url, params)
    response.json()
    Output: {'confidence': 0.128, 'prediction': 'Negative'}

- Using Curl:
    Code:
        $ curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/ -d query='that movie was boring'
    {
        "prediction": "Negative",
        "confidence": 0.128
    }
